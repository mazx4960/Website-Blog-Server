# Website-Blog-Server

A server application to handle the backend of the simple blog website

# About this project

This website was designed for me to learn more about the basic functionality of flask. It started off as a simple blogging website which allows users to post questions and comments. However, over the course of this project, I learnt more than what I expected to and encountered several road blocks. However, as I got more into this project, I envision it to be greater than just a simple blogging website.

In the future, this project could be expanded to become a one stop daily planner for everyone and also allows them to document all of their activities and experiences. This could serve as a one stop portal for users to do regular reflections and also plan out their daily commute and activities. 

# Notes

This website was created using Flask. Flask is a lightweight `WSGI`_ web application framework. It is designed
to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to
complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around `Werkzeug`_
and `Jinja`_ and has become one of the most popular Python web
application frameworks.

Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or
project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and
libraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the
community that make adding new functionality easy.
